# Fibonacci Challenge

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
And the 5 is (2+3), and so on!
Example: the next number in the sequence above is 21+34 = 55

Input n
If n = 1, output should be 1
If n = 2, output should be 1
If n > 2, output should be sum of the previous two values
Print the output of n

```ruby
def fibonacci(n)
  puts "HELLO from fib"
end
```
