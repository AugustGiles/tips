# Fibonacci Function (Review)

 This is a review outline for Mod 2 Fibonacci Function Practice Problem

 ### Guidelines for Review

 - How do we approach these types of problems? Read the instructions carefully and do your best to understand the problem before starting a solution. Read any given inputs and write comments to yourself about what they should return.

 - Explain base cases and how we approach them. In fib function we know that for n=1 and n=2 the return value will always be 1.

 - Introduction to recursion:

  - How can we turn this 10 line iterative solution into a 2 line recursive solution?

  - What does it mean to write a solution recursively? What does it look like to call a function within itself?

  - Show differences between iterative, recursive and memoization solutions.

  - What are input limits for different types of solutions? (iterative threshold is higher)
